## Hi there, I'm Yan Ferreira! 👋

I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Control and Automation Engineering at the Federal University of Minas Gerais 🛠️

💻 I'm also an enthusiastic member of the Computational Intelligence Laboratory (LITC - UFMG).

🤖 In the past, I had the privilege of leading the autonomous robotics team Autobotz - UFMG.

💡 My interests revolve around machine learning, artificial neural networks, data science and robotics.
